# reusable-ui-kits
This is just a sample project for isolating html and css from react apps. We may have multiple projects to work on and may be we are just copy and pasting all ui-components over projects multiple times. Only way to decrease file size is making component files and using it over multiple views. However it do not solves our problem incase of multiple projects.

This is a simple ui-kit for button which we can use just by adding it in our `package.json`.

### How to use:
1. Simply initialize npm.
2. run `npm install Vhndaree/reusable-ui-kit#master` or `yarn add Vhndaree/reusable-ui-kit` if you use yarn
3. import package where ever you want to use in you project.
